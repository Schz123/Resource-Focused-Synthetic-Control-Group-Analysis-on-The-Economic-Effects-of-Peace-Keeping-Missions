# A Resource Focused Synthetic Control Group Analysis on The Economic Effects of Peace Keeping Missions in the DRC And the Ivory Coast

My code is contained in the file `Analysis.m`.

Both the statistics on the Output-side real GDP at chained PPPs, and the population of each country, were retrieved from the Penn World Table data set (version 10.01).

To create the resource-based synthetic countries I used the total natural resource rents as a percentage of the country’s GDP. This data was retrieved from the World Bank Group DataBank.

To assess each country 10 years before the start of the major conflicts beginning, I used data on the number of deaths in each country as a result of violence, gathered by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP).

To recreate Bove and Elia’s optimal synthetic country, I relied on the weights provided in the appendix to the article "Economic Development in Peacekeeping Host Countries.":
Bove, Vincenzo, and Leandro Elia. 2017. "Economic Development in Peacekeeping Host Countries." CESifo Economic Studies 64 (4): 712-728. https://doi.org/10.1093/cesifo/ifx009.
